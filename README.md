# Games_Made_In_High_School
 A collection of mostly unfinished games I made from 2014-2016. For portfolio purposes.

Amorphous Arena:

    RTS game I created from scratch in under 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 35 game developer competition. 
    Created only using C++ and the graphics library SDL.

Business Simulator:

    Small and unfinished web game I started to work on in HTML, CSS, and JS.
    Not much to show off here, but I left it in for archive purposes.

Chapman's Adventure:
    
    Unfinished top-down adventure game. Created using C++ and the graphics library SFML.
    Basic graphics engine implemented but nothing further.

Swipe It! (2014-2015)
    
    First iteration of a mobile-game I had worked on over multiple years. Created with Action-Script 3.0 and the Starling Framework.
    You swipe across an arrow that appears on the screen in a random direction.
    Your goal is to get as many swipes as you can before the delay between your swipes becomes too long. 

Swipe It! (2016)
    
    Final iteration of Swipe It!.
    The graphics have been greatly improved, with animations too.
    The main game mechanics has been improved, with power-ups and a surrounding story. You are trying to keep a generator running.
    The geometric arrow has been replaced with a wire.

Worm Fishing(2014):

    Unfinished game where worms float to the sky and you have to flip a bucket with "realistic" physics to catch them.
    Bucket physics fully functional at the point of abandonment.
